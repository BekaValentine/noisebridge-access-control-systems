# noisebridge-access-control-systems
A repo to collect ideas and resources for designing new models of access control systems at Noisebridge and beyond! A key question we find ourselves wanting to answer is: how can we have trust and access control and privs management in a de-centralized, do-ocratic way?? One cool side benefit of working on this problem is that it might well be novel research and could turn into Noisebridge's first official publication in an academic journal. :)
