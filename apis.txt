________

- Start a folder (apis?) with samples of basic functional code (e.g. like the meet-up I pushed to NB)
- Determine which functions needed across all APIs
    - Getting and revoking API Tokens
    - Integrating API token management with access control scheme
    - Basic API
      - connections / sessoins
      - basic queries
      - what will be posted
      - how to post it
      - partitioning and permissioning each function to suit noisebridge access controls
