- Getting RFID access requires adding contact info of some sort (Nym, Email/Phone/whatever)
- Anyone with access level X can grant access at all levels beneath X
- Anyone with access level X can revoke access at all levels beneath X
- Any group of N people at access level X can grant access at level X (and N must be maintained at all times for access to exist)
- QUESTION: How to revoke same level???
- Access granting is a DAG, so we cannot get un-revocable access loops, and we can cut off entire branches of access that stem from malicious individuals
- Expiring tokens causes the expiration of the entire branch below them (except for nodes that are pointed to by multiple people???)
  -  How about the expired person can expire without their children auto-expire.  
    - Auto-expire is really a revoke anyways.  Those people are still useful.  
    - Perhaps a will-ful keeping (notiifcation to keep on parent expire) or 
    - ability to expire all but not by default (notificatoin of expiry so person can act if desired).  
  - However, if person n is revoked, all children revoked, as revoking is a Trust issue.
- The entire access grand DAG is viewable in the space at all times, and all changes are logged publicly on slack and on the system that shows the DAG

* NOTE Access levels here are the current NB levels of Daytime Access and 24 Hour Access, and are intended to be time-period-relevant levels of access to the RFID space, and not other systems. For more general access control, these levels of access are whatever they are in that context.


- Rings of trust may also be interesting
  - DAG but allow one and only one cycle with a minimum of Nr people in the ring.
  - This could be useful for critical emails, for example.
    - Treasurer recovery -> Secretary, Secretary recovery -> President, etc.
  - Not perfect or even great, but adding obstacles to make attacks more difficult / costly is interesting.

- Absolutely zero key people dependencies.  
  - This is a risk bigger than any specific account.
