- Getting RFID access requires adding contact info of some sort (Nym, Email/Phone/whatever)
- Anyone with access level X can grant access at all levels beneath X
- Anyone with access level X can revoke access at all levels beneath X
- Any group of N people at access level X can grant access at level X (and N must be maintained at all times for access to exist)
- QUESTION: How to revoke same level???
- Access granting is a DAG, so we cannot get un-revocable access loops, and we can cut off entire branches of access that stem from malicious individuals
- Expiring tokens causes the expiration of the entire branch below them (except for nodes that are pointed to by multiple people???)
- The entire access grand DAG is viewable in the space at all times, and all changes are logged publicly on slack and on the system that shows the DAG

* NOTE Access levels here are the current NB levels of Daytime Access and 24 Hour Access, and are intended to be time-period-relevant levels of access to the RFID space, and not other systems. For more general access control, these levels of access are whatever they are in that context.
